          <p>
            We are a community of passionate developers, investors, anda
            enthusiasts from all corners of Istanbul. As a group that believes
            in the power of blockchain technology and understands the importance

            we all share a common goal: to strive for Istanbul to become a hub
            in the blockchain and crypto world.
